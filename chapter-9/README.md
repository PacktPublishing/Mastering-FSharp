# Instructions

> Make sure you have installed dependencies, see README in parent directory.

You can just send the code in the `.fsx` script files to F# interactive
normally. There is also a FAKE build target you can try, in the **parent
directory** run `build CompileAndRunTests` (or `sh build.sh CompileAndRunTests`
in unix systems).

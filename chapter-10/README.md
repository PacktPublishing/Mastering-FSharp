# Instructions

There are FAKE build targets to compile and run each of the projects
in this directory. For example, to run `Chat.MailboxProcessor` in the
**parent directory** type:

`build chapter-10/chapter-10/MailboxProcessor`

> In unix systems use `sh build.sh chapter-10/chapter-10/MailboxProcessor`

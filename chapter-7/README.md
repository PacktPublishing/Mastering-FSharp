# Instructions

> Make sure you have installed dependencies, see README in parent directory.

## Suave server

In this directory, run `fsi Suave.fsx` (or `fsharpi Suave.fsx` on Mac)
and open `localhost:8083` in your web browser. Try modify the code in
`Suave.fsx` or `template.html` to see the results.

Check [Suave website](https://suave.io) for more information.

## Fable web

In this directory, run `npm run fable` (or `node ../node_modules/fable-compiler`
which is equivalent), the open `index.html` directly with a browser.

If you activate `--watch` mode (`npm run fable -- -w`), Fable will automatically
recompile the project much faster on file changes.

Check [Fable website](https://fable.io) for more information.

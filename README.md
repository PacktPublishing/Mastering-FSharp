#Mastering __F#__
This is the code repository for [Mastering F#](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-f?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784393434), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
F# is a multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming language properties. Now adopted in a wide range of application areas and is supported both by industry-leading companies who provide professional tools and by an active open community, F# is rapidly gaining popularity as it emerges in digital music advertising, creating music-focused ads for Spotify, Pandora, Shazam, and anywhere on the web.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Before running any code dependencies must be installed. To do this, run:

`.paket/paket.exe install`

> On Mono, use `mono .paket/paket.exe install` instead.

To run [Fable](http://fable.io) samples, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed in the system.
You can install JavaScript dependencies by running:

`npm install`

For chapters 5 and 6, just use [F# interactive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/)
to run the code in the `.fsx` script files. For the rest of the chapters, see the `README.md`
file in the respective folders.
The code will look like the following:
```
let x = 20
if not (x < 10) then
printfn "x is greater than 10"
```

All you need for this book is a computer that can comfortably run the following software
applications: An F# IDE like Visual Studio 2015 (with Visual F# Power Tools), Visual Studio
for Mac or Visual Studio Code with the Ionide extension.

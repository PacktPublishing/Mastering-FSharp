# INSTRUCTIONS

Dependencies are in the root folder, make sure you have
run `npm install` there.

Download the Roboto font from https://fonts.google.com.
After downloading the zip file, extract `Roboto-Medium.ttf`
and put it next to `app/css/styles.css`.

Run `npm run fable` to compile the F# code to JS, then
`npm start` to start the application.
